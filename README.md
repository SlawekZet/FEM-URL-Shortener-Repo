## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Typescript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - node.js framework
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - to deploy page and server
- [CleanUri](https://cleanuri.com/) - API to shorten the URLs

### What I learned

I needed to learn the basics of Express.JS to be able to set up a server and cover the CORS policy issue I had when I tried to connect to the Clean URI API
